[Description]
Github for Windows client version 1.0.36

[Installation]
Need .NET 4 framework and Powershell (optional)
Extract zip file to your %programfiles%\Github or somewhere else
run github.exe, it will configure tools and install to %APPDATA%
configure you account!

Note:
github will create git-shell shortcut on your desktop, this doesn't work as it point to latest version online.
as workaround edit the shortcut and change target into "%programfiles%\Github\github.exe" --open-shell
